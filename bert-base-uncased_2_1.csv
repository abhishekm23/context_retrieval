1019,the wages in thuringia are low compared to rich bordering lands like hesse and bavaria.,"then, it has decreased to 7 % in 2013, which is only slightly above the national average. the decrease is caused on the one hand by the emergence of new jobs and on the other by a marked decrease in the working - age population, caused by emigration and low birth rates for decades. the wages in thuringia are low compared to rich bordering lands like hesse and bavaria. therefore, many thuringians are working in other german lands and even in austria and switzerland as weekly commuters. nevertheless, the demographic transition in thuringia leads to a lack of workers in some sectors. external immigration into thuringia has been encouraged by the government since about 2010 to counter this problem.
