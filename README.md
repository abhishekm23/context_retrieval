### Problem statement

Language models have tremendous utility. With the advent of multi-headed attention-based Transformer models, language generation, translation, and many other tasks have now become relatively easy. This has brought about a significant increase in the use of language models across different fields.

There is one caveat though. Language model representations of text are not fully interpretable. This makes it harder to understand what exactly are these models inferring from text. This leads to another problem, one of contextual retrievability. How much information are these language models actually able to retrieve from long contexts, or any context for that matter? Does the location of information in a context directs if a language model will be able to infer anything from it? This is what our focus and problem statement is based on. 

**Determine the ability of a language model to retrieve information from context through a question-answering task. Check if there's a trend in accuracy depending on the location of the answer in the context and the context size.**

### Dataset description

We are using the SQuAD-2.0 dataset for this task. It contains multiple questions on a single paragraph, with varying locations of the answers to those questions. It also contains 50k unanswerable questions, i.e. questions that can't be answered from the given context.

This dataset was created by the authors of the paper **"Know What You Don't Know: Unanswerable Questions for SQuAD"**, and is loaded in this notebook from the datasets API of the Hugging Face library.

There are mostly **5 or 10 questions** asked per document in the dataset.


```python

```

    Average context length is 754.5662873410631

We can see a huge spike in the graph above around context length of 700 which is also justified by the 
the mean context length calculated above for the dataset.


```python
# Visualizing the distribution of answer start index for the entire dataset

df['answer_text'] = df['answers'].apply(lambda x: x['text'][0] if len(x['text'])>0 else '')
df['start_index']= df['answers'].apply(lambda x: x['answer_start'][0] if len(x['answer_start'])>0 else -1)

We can see that the dataset is already stratified on the relative answer position, with a spike at 0 due to unanswerable questions. It's perfect for evaluating the trend of accuracy with the relative position of the answer.

## Sampling Strategy

We create 3 samples, all stratified on different characteristics. The reason for that is we have computational limitations preventing us from obtaining predictions on the entire dataset in a small span of time. Here are the criteria for stratifying the sample.

1. Equal distribution of answer start index buckets.
2. Equal distribution of the buckets of relative answer position.
3. Equal distribution of context length buckets.

We chose a 1% sample for each of the criteria mentioned above. We'll further our research by predicting on an even larger sample.


```python
bins = [0,600,700,1000,5000]
df['context_cat'] = pd.cut(df['context_length'], bins=bins)
df_context_cat_valc = df['context_cat'].value_counts().rename_axis('unique_values').reset_index(name='counts')


plt.figure(figsize = (10,5))
plt.title("Distribution of context length across documents (bucketed)")
ax = sns.barplot(x = 'unique_values',
            y = 'counts',
            data = df_context_cat_valc,
            palette = "Oranges")

ax.set(xlabel='Context length range', ylabel='Count')
plt.show()
# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

```python
# Barplot showing the number of documents for each of the answer start index range. 

bins = [-1,0,150,400,5000]
df['answer_start_cat']= pd.cut(df['start_index'], bins=bins,include_lowest=True,right=False)
df_answer_start_cat = df['answer_start_cat'].value_counts().rename_axis('unique_values').reset_index(name='counts')

plt.figure(figsize = (10,5))

            palette = "Blues")

## Stratified Sampling 

After categorizing the target variables (context length, answer start index and relative answer position in the document) we perform stratified sampling and produce the three samples stratified on different metrics.

This has already been done and the stored files are imported below the stratified sampling code.


```python
# df.head()

# for col in ['context_cat', 'answer_start_cat', 'answer_pos_cat']:
#     df[col] = df[col].astype(str)
```


```python
# train_context_length, test_context_length = train_test_split(df,
#                                                     stratify=df.context_cat, 
#                                                     test_size=0.01,random_state=42)

# test_context_length.to_csv('df_context.csv', index = False)
```


```python
# train_answer_pos, test_answer_pos = train_test_split(df,
#                                                     stratify=df.answer_pos_cat, 
#                                                     test_size=0.01,random_state=42)

# test_answer_pos.to_csv('answer_pos.csv', index = False)
```


```python
# train_answer_start, test_answer_start = train_test_split(df,
#                                                     stratify=df.answer_start_cat, 
#                                                     test_size=0.01,random_state=42)

# test_answer_start.to_csv('answer_start.csv', index = False)
```


```python
dataset1 = pd.read_csv('answer_start.csv') 
dataset2 = pd.read_csv('answer_pos.csv')
dataset3 = pd.read_csv('df_context.csv')
```

# Model pipeline

This section includes the build of the open-source masked language modeling-based models for question answering. We have used **Longformer (max context length 4096)** and **BERT (max context length 512)**. 

The reason for this choice of models was to have one large-context and one small-context models and compare their performance on a question answering task. 

Not only do we require the accuracies but we also want to understand if the contextual retrievability of either of these models is consistent across different regions in the document.

**Modular code for obtaining predictions** - We build a class that takes the dataset as input, the number of questions that need to be processed, the max context length that needs to be considered, and the model that you are using. Then we initialize this class and run the functions within to obtain predictions.

The prediction pipeline is also built using the **Hugging Face** library. It provides an easy way to import language model heads and tokenizers that can be used to build a model for any use case.


```python
class QAmodel:
    def __init__(self, dataset, model, num_questions, max_length):
        
        # Initialize some variables
        
        self.dataset = dataset
        self.model = model
        self.num_questions = num_questions
        self.max_length = max_length
        self.model_answers_df = None
        
    
    # Function for returning answers to an input set of question and context

    def long_context_qa(self, question, context):
        
        # We need a different Tokenizer and different QuestionAnswering head for the longformer model
        # For most other models the AutoTokenizer class and the AutoModel class should work
        # If GPU is available, then we load the model to a GPU using cuda
        
        if self.model == "allenai/longformer-large-4096-finetuned-triviaqa":
            tokenizer = transformers.LongformerTokenizer.from_pretrained(self.model)
            model_call = transformers.LongformerForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(self.model)
            model_call.to("cuda")
        else:
            tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(self.model)
            model_call = transformers.AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(self.model)
            model_call.to('cuda')
        
        # Here we tokenize the inputs, depending on the model, different tokenizer with different max_context_length will be called
        
        inputs = tokenizer(question, context, padding="max_length",truncation=True,
                       return_tensors="pt",max_length = self.max_length)
        
        # If GPU is available we load the inputs to GPU using CUDA
        
        inputs.to("cuda")
        
        # We'll call the model without calling gradients
        
        with torch.no_grad():
            output = model_call(**inputs)
        
        # The model gives multiple outputs, it'll give logits corresponding all possible start and end indices
        # We'll pick the indices with highest logits 
        
        answer_start = torch.argmax(output['start_logits']).item()
        answer_end = torch.argmax(output['end_logits']).item()
        
        # We'll select the answer from the inputs based on the selected answer start and end logits 
        
        input_ids = inputs["input_ids"][0].cpu().numpy()
        answer_tokens = input_ids[answer_start:answer_end + 1]
        
        # The tokenizer will decode the answer from the selected tokens 
        answer = tokenizer.decode(answer_tokens)
        
        return answer

    # This function will give you if there's a match
    # We're not using exact match, rather we're checking if the actual answer is present in the predicted answer
    # This is being done only for answerable questions for now
    
    @staticmethod
    def answer_matcher(actual, predicted):
        try:
            return 1 if actual in predicted else 0
        except:
            return np.nan
        
    
    # Here we'll sequentially call the question answering function for all question, context pairs in the dataset
    
    def process_questions(self):
        model_answers = []
        
        for i in tqdm(range(self.num_questions)):
            answer = self.long_context_qa(self.dataset['question'][i], self.dataset['context'][i])
            model_answers.append(answer)

        self.model_answers_df = pd.DataFrame({
            'actual_answer': self.dataset['answer_text'][:self.num_questions],
            'predicted_answer': model_answers
        })
        
        # Lowercase actual and predicted answers and call answer matcher to obtain match 
        
        self.model_answers_df.actual_answer = self.model_answers_df.actual_answer.str.strip().str.lower()
        self.model_answers_df.predicted_answer = self.model_answers_df.predicted_answer.str.strip().str.lower()
        self.model_answers_df['answer_match'] = self.model_answers_df.apply(

# Defining a list of models to be tested and their context lengths 

models = ["bert-base-uncased", "allenai/longformer-large-4096-finetuned-triviaqa"]
context_lengths = [512, 4096]
```

It takes quite some time to run the code below, it was run on Colab and the files were saved, this should be run on systems with high RAM and preferably with GPU.


```python
# # Iterate over all datasets and models

# i = 0
# for dataset in [dataset1, dataset2, dataset3]:
#     temp_dataset = dataset.copy()
#     for model,context_length in zip(models, context_lengths):
        
#         # Call the QAmodel class
#         d_qamodel = QAmodel(temp_dataset, model, len(temp_dataset), context_length)
        
#         # Obtain answers using the process_questions function
#         answers = d_qamodel.process_questions()
        
#         # Define a nomenclature for the files to be stored, this can be altered later 
#         key = model[8:]+'_'+str(i)
#         answers.to_csv(key+'.csv')
    
#     i+=1
```

# Results

We evaluate the results in this section. We check how the accuracy changes with the answer start index, this trend can be observed for other stratified samples too.

The observations below are for one BERT output and 1 Longformer output. We have used the BERT output on the sample stratified on the answer start index, while for Longformer we have used the output on the sample stratified on the context length.


```python
# function for postprocessing the predictions and retrieving the results along with original files

def prepare_results(df_train, df_predict,by):
    
    # Convert the answers to lowercase
    df_train['answer_text'] = df_train['answer_text'].astype(str).apply(lambda x: x.lower())
    
    # Join the answers table to the original table
    df_merged = pd.concat([df_train, df_predict],axis=1)
    
    # Replace NaNs with empty strings
    df_merged['actual_answer'].fillna('',inplace=True)
    df_merged['predicted_answer'].fillna('',inplace=True)
    df_merged['answer_match'].fillna(0,inplace=True)
    
    # To obtain accuracy for unanswerable cases, if the model outputs nothing to unanswerable questions, we consider that an answer match
    df_merged['both_empty'] = np.where((df_merged['actual_answer'] == '') & (df_merged['predicted_answer'] == ''),1, 0)
    df_merged['answer_match'] = df_merged['answer_match'] + df_merged['both_empty']
    df_stats = df_merged[[by,'answer_match']].groupby(by).mean()*100
    df_stats = df_stats.reset_index()

## Inference

It can be inferred that while Longformer in general has a much better accuracy than BERT, both these models perform poorly when the answer is located towards the end of the context.

**Next steps**:

1. This is merely an observation on a small sample. To confirm the actual trend, we need to obtain results on the entire dataset without any sampling.

2. We also need to vary the language model heads used. How does the accuracy change if we use the CausalLM head (causal language modeling) instead of the question answering head, and pass prompts instead of question-context pairs?

3. We need to try bigger datasets and bigger language models.

These steps will help arrive at a more reliable observation about the contextual retrievability of large language models. But we do have a certain degree of confidence based on the initial observations that language models lack the ability of inferring from contexts irrespective of the location of the information.
